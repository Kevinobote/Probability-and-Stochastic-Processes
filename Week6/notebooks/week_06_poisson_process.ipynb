    "Imagine you're working at a call center. Phone calls seem to arrive at random, but you know that on average, you get about 10 calls per hour. The Poisson process is the perfect tool to model this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a **counting process**. It counts the number of events (e.g., phone calls, emails, customers arriving, radioactive decays) that have occurred up to a certain point in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key intuitive ideas are:\n",
    "1.  Events happen at a constant average **rate**.\n",
    "2.  The timing of one event tells you nothing about when the next one will occur (the process is **memoryless**).\n",

    "\n",
    "The Poisson process, denoted \\(N(t)\\), counts the number of events up to time \\(t\\). It's defined by a few simple but powerful properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Starts at Zero:** The count begins at time 0, so \\(N(0) = 0\\).\n",
    "2.  **Independent Increments:** The number of events in one time interval is independent of the number of events in any *non-overlapping* time interval. (The number of calls between 9 AM and 10 AM doesn't affect the number of calls between 2 PM and 3 PM).\n",
    "3.  **Stationary Increments:** The probability distribution of the number of events depends only on the *length* of the time interval, not its location. (The probability of getting 5 calls in any 1-hour window is the same, whether it's 9-10 AM or 2-3 PM).\n",
    "4.  **Rate of Events:** For a very small time interval \\(h\\), the probability of one event occurring is approximately \\(\\lambda h\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the constant rate of events. The probability of more than one event is essentially zero."

For a Poisson process, the inter-arrival times \\(T_1, T_2, ...\\) are independent and identically distributed random variables, each following an **Exponential distribution** with rate \\(\\lambda\\).\n",
