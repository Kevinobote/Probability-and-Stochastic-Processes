    "Imagine a tiny particle, like a grain of pollen, suspended in water. When you look at it under a microscope, you'll see it moving around in a random, jittery, and unpredictable way. This is because it's constantly being bombarded by water molecules. This phenomenon, first observed by Robert Brown, is the classic image of **Brownian motion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a **random walk in continuous time**. Instead of taking a discrete step every second, the particle is taking infinitely many, infinitesimally small random steps at all times. The result is a path that is continuous (it doesn't teleport), but also incredibly erratic and \"jagged\"."

    "\n",
    "Brownian motion (also called a **Wiener Process**) is a specific type of continuous-time stochastic process, denoted \\(W(t)\\) or \\(W_t\\). Its behavior is defined by a few key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Starts at Zero:** The process always starts at the origin: \\(W(0) = 0\\).\n",
    "2.  **Continuous Paths:** The path \\(W(t)\\) is continuous everywhere. There are no jumps.\n",
    "3.  **Independent Increments:** The change in the process over one time interval, \\(W(t) - W(s)\\), is independent of the change over any other *non-overlapping* interval, \\(W(v) - W(u)\\).\n",
    "4.  **Normal, Stationary Increments:** The change over any time interval of length \\(s\\) is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a variance equal to the length of the interval, \\(s\\). \n",
    "    - That is, \\(W(t+s) - W(t) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, s)\\).\n",
    "    - This also means \\(W(t) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)\\), since \\(W(t) = W(t) - W(0)\\)."

    "**Definition: Standard Brownian Motion (or Wiener Process)**\n",
    "A stochastic process \\({W(t), t \\ge 0}\\) is a standard Brownian motion if it satisfies:\n",
    "1.  \\(W(0) = 0\\).\n",
    "2.  With probability 1, the function \\(t \\mapsto W(t)\\) is continuous in \\(t\\).\n",
    "3.  The process has independent increments.\n",
    "4.  For any \\(s < t\\), the increment \\(W(t) - W(s)\\) is a random variable from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance \\(t-s\\): \\(W(t) - W(s) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t-s)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is Brownian Motion a Martingale?**\n",
    "Yes! A standard Brownian motion is a martingale. We can check the condition \\(E[W(t) | \\mathcal{F}_s] = W(s)\\) for \\(s < t\\).\n",
    "\\(E[W(t) | \\mathcal{F}_s] = E[W(t) - W(s) + W(s) | \\mathcal{F}_s]\\)\n",

    "- Because \\(W(s)\\) is known at time \\(s\\), \\(E[W(s) | \\mathcal{F}_s] = W(s)\\).\n",
    "So, \\(E[W(t) | \\mathcal{F}_s] = 0 + W(s) = W(s)\\). It satisfies the martingale property."
