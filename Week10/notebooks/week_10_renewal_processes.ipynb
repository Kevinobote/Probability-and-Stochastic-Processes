    "Remember the Poisson process, which modeled events like calls arriving at a call center? A key assumption was that the time between calls followed an **Exponential distribution**. This implies the process is \"memoryless.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the time between events isn't memoryless? Think of replacing a machine part. The time until it fails (and is \"renewed\") might not be exponential. A new part is less likely to fail than an old one. Or perhaps failures tend to happen around a specific average lifetime, but with some variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **renewal process** is a counting process that handles this. It's like a Poisson process, but the time between events (the \"lifetimes\") can follow **any** probability distribution, as long as they are independent and identically distributed (IID)."

    "\n",
    "1.  **The Inter-arrival Times:** Let \\(T_1, T_2, T_3, ...\\) be the times between consecutive events. In a renewal process, these \\(T_i\\) are assumed to be **independent and identically distributed (IID)** positive random variables.\n",
